# Slot Machine

A very simple slot machine made in C++

This my first project I ever created in C++ in the first year of a software engineering degree.

### Game Instructions
In this game, you begin with 2000 chips and bet an amount of your choosing
in an attempt to win.
The slot machine will generate 3 random numbers, and your payouts will be as follows:

Three 7's       -  win 10x your bet
Three of a kind -  win 5x your bet
Two of a kind   -  win 3x your bet
Anything else   -  lose your bet

If you run out of chips, the game will end.
